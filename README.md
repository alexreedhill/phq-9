## PHQ-9

This is my take on implementing a simple client-side PHQ-9 questionnaire. It makes use of React, Redux, and React Router. I used a boilerplate project (https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) to get started. The code I wrote can be found in the `src/` and `tests/` directories. The coverage tool is reporting ~95% test coverage. I didn't spend much time on the design, just enough to make it usable.

#### Run App

```

npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
